# Relationships Between Presidents Twitter and Political Issues

Twitter is one of the most popular social media in U.S. and used by influential politicians
including US presidents. Twitter has been proven to be a tool to predict the real world. There
are many researches on the relationship between Twitter and stock market. The most famous
study is Twitter mood predicts the stock market by J Bollen which has been cited more than
3000 times. In this project, we sought to answer a question: Do politiciansâ€™ tweets match to their
real-life behaviors? With the answer of this question, we can forecast the changes of political
concerns by analyzing tweets.

# Introduction
The purpose of the project is analyzing the Twitter behaviors of Donald Trump and Barack Obama
and comparing their Twitter behaviors to what they do in the government. We will explore their
tweets by a Natural Language Processing approch, and find out their characteristics. We will
compare their tweets to find the changes of political concerns.
